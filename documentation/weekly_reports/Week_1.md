# Week 1
### Time spent: 5 hours

## This week
This week was mostly spent on choosing the topic for the project, finding information about possible implementations, and initializing the project itself.
I learned about the general use cases of Markov chains and a bit of its history. I also familiarized myself with the concept of a trie and prepared for its implementation.

## Challenges
At this stage, it's quite hard to name any challenges, as I still don't possess a throughout understanding of the data structure, or the algorithm I'm going to use for the project.

## Next week
Next week I'll start the actual research and development of the project. I plan to have the trie up and running and begin working with initializing it with the list of English words.
