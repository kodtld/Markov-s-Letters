# Week 5
### Time spent: 9 hours

## This week
This week I finished the UI for the program, and made it so that the one- and two-state generations are possible trough the application. Sentences can be generated with or without starting prompts. I also wrote tests for the markov chain, aswell as performance tests for the trie and markov chain. The current performance can be found in the [test Document](https://github.com/kodtld/Markov-s-Letters/blob/master/documentation/testing.md).

## Challenges
This week felt less challenging than previous ones. I've gotten quite familiar with tries aswell as markov chain generation.

## Next week
Next week I'll make the final state option which allows for more than two-state generation of sentences.
Also I'll make the application usable with all of the upcoming functionality.
The peer reviewer couldn't run the program on their machine, so I'll get the project to such a state that it can be run on most machines.
